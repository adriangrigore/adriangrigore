### Hi, I'm Adi 👋

I'm a minimalist freelancer 💻 and an indie developer 🚀.

I've been doing web development for almost 20 years, I'm currently
exploring the <abbr title='Uniplexed Information and
Computing Service'>UNIX</abbr> world and how it can be used to develop
modern websites.

I recently grew tired of the JavaScript landscape and built a simple
static site generator 🌐. You can check it out at https://mkws.sh.
